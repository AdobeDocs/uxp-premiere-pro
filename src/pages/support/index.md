Additional Premiere Pro Developer Resources

## Sample Files and Resources

Code samples and developer resources can all be found on our [github repo](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP).

## UXP Developer Tools

The UXP Developer Tools (UDT) application is the bridge between your IDE and Premiere Pro.  Write code in whichever editor is your favorite.  When you're ready to launch your UXP panel in Premiere Pro, UDT provides a streamlined path to load, launch and debug your panel directly in Premiere Pro.  You can even revise your code back in your IDE and reload these revisions to continue testing without having to close and relaunch Premiere Pro.

More informaion on using UDT with Premiere Pro is also available in the [Sample Files and Resources](#sample-files-and-resources) above.
