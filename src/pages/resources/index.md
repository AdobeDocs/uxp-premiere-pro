# Resources

By now, we hope that you have already tried a simple plugin by following the "getting started" guides.

The resources here are meant for you to deep dive into UXP and build something more useful for real-world scenarios.

Start by reading the [fundamentals](./fundamentals/), and move to the [recipes](./recipes/). These aim to provide bite-sized examples for common use cases. Following that, explore the APIs in the [References](../changelog/) section.
