## Answers

<!-- Let's keep the answers in the same order as the questions! -->
<!-- ðŸ“¦ Installers and Packages -->

#### My `.ccx` package is being rejected when submitted to the Creative Cloud Marketplace. What could be wrong?

Check if the [`host`](../../plugins/concepts/manifest/index.md#host) property in your `manifest.json` is an object, not an array. If it's an array, the validation will fail. See [Host Applications](../distribution/package/index.md#host-applications) for details.

#### Should I use an Array or an Object for the `host` property in the `manifest.json`?

The `host` property must be a single [`HostDefinition`](../../plugins/concepts/manifest/index.md#hostdefinition) Object for production. Arrays are only allowed during development for convenience. See the [Package a UXP plugin](../distribution/package/index.md#host-applications) section for details.

<!-- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º EU Compliance & DSA Requirements -->

#### Why is my plugin not visible in the EU region?

This could be due to incomplete or outdated trader information in your publisher profile. Please make sure all required details are updated and accurate.

#### How can I update my trader details in the publisher profile after submission?

To update only your trader details in the publisher profile after submission, please contact our team at [ccintrev@adobe.com](mailto:ccintrev@adobe.com). At this time, we are not processing change requests for other fields in the publisher profile.

#### What happens if an EU user has a deep link to my plugin and I am not compliant with the European Union Digital Services Act (DSA) trader requirements?

If you are not compliant with the European Union Digital Services Act trader requirements, an EU user with a deep link to your plugin will not be able to install it. They will see a banner with a message indicating the compliance issue.

#### Can an EU user still use my plugin if they have already installed it, but I am not compliant with the DSA trader requirements?

Yes, if an EU user has already installed your plugin, they will still be able to use it even if you are not compliant with the DSA trader requirements. However, they will see a banner with a message indicating the compliance issue.
