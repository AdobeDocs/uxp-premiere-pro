# Our Review Process

If you are looking to distribute your plugin to the Adobe Creative Cloud Marketplace, you will need to submit it for review.

## Overview

Plugins submitted to the Creative Cloud Marketplace always go through a review process, designed to ensure that every product—whether free or paid—meets Adobe's quality standards.

A dedicated team carefully audits and approves extensibility listings. To help avoid delays and keep the review queue moving smoothly, please ensure your plugin fully complies with our requirements.
