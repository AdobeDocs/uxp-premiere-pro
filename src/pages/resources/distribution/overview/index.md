# Distribution Overview

Congratulations! You've built a great UXP plugin and you're ready to release it to the world or share it with your team.

The UXP ecosystem gives you freedom to share your plugin via different platforms, most commonly:

1. **Creative Cloud Marketplace** (recommended for broad reach)

   - Requires submitting your plugin to Adobe for **review and approval**.
   - Once published, your plugin is **discoverable** directly within Creative Cloud applications.
   - Plugins published to the Marketplace are available for **free or paid** use.

2. **Direct Distribution** (best for Enterprise use or independent marketplaces)
   - **No review or approval** is required if you share your plugin independently.
   - You can **host your plugin anywhere**—for example, your own website, GitHub, or a third-party store.

Regardless of where you distribute—whether free or paid—the plugin must be packaged as a `.ccx` file. This format ensures users can install it seamlessly via the Creative Cloud desktop in the supported host applications.

The process is remarkably simple, and the following sections will guide you through the steps.
