# Distribution Overview

Congratulations on building your UXP plugin! You're now ready to release it to the world or share it with your team.

The UXP ecosystem gives you flexibility to distribute your plugin across multiple platforms. Most commonly:

1. **Creative Cloud Marketplace** (recommended for broad reach)

   - Requires submitting your plugin to Adobe for **review and approval**.
   - Once published, your plugin is **discoverable** directly within the Creative Cloud Desktop application.
   - Plugins published to the Marketplace are available for **free or paid** use.

2. **Direct Distribution** (best for Enterprise use or independent marketplaces)
   - **No review or approval** is required if you share your plugin independently.
   - You can **host your plugin** on platforms such as your own website, GitHub, or a third-party store.

Regardless of where you distribute them, plugins must be packaged. UXP introduces a new package format called `.ccx`, which provides a seamless installation experience via the Creative Cloud desktop in all supported host applications.

The process is straightforward; read on to learn more about how to package and distribute your plugin.
