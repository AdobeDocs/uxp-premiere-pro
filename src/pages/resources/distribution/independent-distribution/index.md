# Independent Distribution

With UXP it's easy to distribute your plugin independently through multiple channels.

## Overview

Once you have [packaged your plugin](../package/index.md), you can share the `.ccx` installer with anyone (within your organization or with the public) as you see fit.

The only precaution is that you should make a clone of your plugin with a different ID, **only if _also_ you plan to distribute your plugin through the Creative Cloud Marketplace**, as explained in [this page](../package/index.md#mind-your-plugins-id).
