# Distributing UXP Plugins Independently

UXP makes it easy to distribute your plugin independently across multiple channels

## Overview

Once you have [packaged your plugin](../package/index.md), you can share the `.ccx` installer with anyone (colleagues or external users) based on your distribution strategy.

Consider cloning your plugin with a different ID **only if _also_ you plan to distribute your plugin through the Creative Cloud Marketplace**, as explained in the [Packaging guide](../package/index.md#mind-your-plugins-id).

When distributing your plugin outside the Creative Cloud Marketplace, users will have the same experience described [here](../install/index.md#installation)â€”including the warning dialog that suggests to only install plugins from trusted sources.
