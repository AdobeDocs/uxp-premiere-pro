# UXP Plugins: Panel and Extensions


With the release of UXP in Premiere Pro public beta, you may notice that we universally refer to *panels* and *extensions* built with UXP as ***plugins***. This is a change compared to the previous use of this terminology in Premiere Pro, where plugins referred primarily to in-app or third party effects in Premiere Pro. 

While this continues to be the case, ***plugins*** will also be used as an ecompassing word for UXP to describe *panels*, *extensions*, and eventually *scripts* as well. The primary reason for this is to maintain consistency with other Adobe Creative Cloud applications that refer to UXP extensions as plugins, including Photoshop and InDesign.
