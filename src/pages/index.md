## Overview

UXP (**U**nified e**X**tensibility **P**latform) is an integration framework built into Premiere Pro and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications. It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere Pro functions at a programmatic level. With UXP, you can build unique tools that integrate with and optimize the most precise, demanding workflows. These tools reduce repetition, maximize efficiency, and transform Premiere Pro into a bespoke application tailored to the needs of any project.

Premiere Pro adds its own APIs on top of the base UXP functionality. This website provides documentation for both APIs.
