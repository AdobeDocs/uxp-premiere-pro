# Premiere Pro and Unified Extensibility Platform (UXP)

Premiere Pro Beta now supports UXP.

UXP is a JavaScript ES6 (ECMA2015) based extensibility platform that helps you automate, optimize and extend the capabilities of your favorite Adobe Creative Cloud products. It provides a comprehensive solution that lets you use web technologies to build controls for the desktop application.

An **IMPORTANT** thing to note is that though UXP enables you to use web technologies, it should not be mistaken as a browser. Certain concepts of the browser will never be available in the UXP world, but the platform offers a plethora of capabilities that allow you to build powerful and creative solutions.

With UXP you can,

1. Automate the myriad, small, repetitive tasks that you face every day.
2. Achieve creative effects that would be difficult or impossible to attain by other means.
3. Customize Premiere Pro to match your work habits and layouts.
4. Create a fluent user interface with which users can interact.

UXP is also available in other apps such as Photoshop and InDesign. And in the future, it will be added to more applications.

Developing in UXP requires you to have basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. To help you on your way to understanding our APIs, we have suggested a few courses and materials.

You can choose to write individual JavaScript files and execute them as scripts, or create something more complex and elaborate with persistent and fluent UI in the form of plugins. Within plugins too, you can either write a 'command' or a 'panel' plugin, based on how you want users to interact with them. These will be explained in subsequent sections.

Lastly, you can share your UXP plugins and scripts with others. Plugins can also be distributed for sale in Adobe's Marketplace giving you access to millions of application users at once. Alternatively, you can distribute them via your own channels.

Welcome once again to UXP! The next few sections take you one level deeper into the UXP world. Make sure to read further and set up the essential developer tools.
