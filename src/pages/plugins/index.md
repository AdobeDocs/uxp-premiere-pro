# UXP Plugins

Premiere Pro v25.2 introduces UXP plugins.

Plugins allow you to build extensive UI and interactive components for users. <!-- Read the [introduction to plugins](../introduction/next-steps/script-and-plugin/) to understand if plugins are the right fit for your use case before proceeding. -->

This section will help you write your first plugin, and explains important concepts required to understand how plugins work.
