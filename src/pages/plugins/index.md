# UXP Plugins

Premiere Pro v25.1 introduces UXP plugins.

With plugins, you can build extensive UI and more interacting components for the users. Read the [introduction to <!--scripts--> plugins](../introduction/next-steps/script-and-plugin/) to understand if plugins are the right fit for your use case before proceeding. 

This section will help you write your first plugin, and explain important concepts required to understand how plugins work.
